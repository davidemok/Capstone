    <p id="about">Hi, I’m Maia. Welcome to my store~! As you can see, there’s quite a variety of handmade objects. I have a lot of hobbies that I’m interested in! There are three main categories, though they all fall under the broad banner of fiber arts-- quilts, clothing, accessories, and yarn items. <br> <br>

        I started off with sewing- starting when I was around 8, my mom taught me to quilt, and we made a few dresses together as well. I even sewed my wedding gown! I learned most of my clothing-making skills from attempting to recreate costumes from different shows, altering thrifted items, and watching my favorite online creators on YouTube. <br> <br>
       
       In high school I learned to knit from a chemistry teacher who was trying to start a knitting club. I made nothing much for a few years, then decided one day to go all out and ended up learning a lot, and enjoying the process. I can also crochet, though I prefer the look and feel of knitted clothing. Crochet is most suitable for making quick blankets, accessories, and toys (called amigurumi). <br> <br>
       
       What I enjoy most about crafting is that there is always a new technique to learn. I have so many hobbies partially because I have ADHD, and so many things are always vying for my attention. When I’m in a sewing rut, knitting takes my interest, and vice versa. I have long term projects, but I also like to do things that are quick and inspire me. For example, the fish pochette on my page was a one-day project-- inspired while playing Animal Crossing, I decided to recreate it so I could wear it too.  Learning new techniques and making complex items can be inspiring and mentally stimulating, and the sense of accomplishment when you finish is second to none. <br> <br>
       
       My shop is only stocked with already-completed items. I find this the easiest way to ensure everything is shipped in a timely manner after an order is received. It also allows me to create what I love! Unfortunately, this limits customization. I have done commissions in the past, but often get caught up in ensuring that every detail is to the customer’s liking, and neglect my own personal style and creativity. It makes the process slow and not as enjoyable. However, I am open to suggestions in between restocks, i.e., making something in another color. <br> <br>
       
       Thank you for visiting! </p>
